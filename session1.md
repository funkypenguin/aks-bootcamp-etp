# So what is Kubernetes?

1) Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services.
2) It facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. 
3) It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem - Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.

2) CI/CD - It won't build your app or containers, or manage source control or deployments
3) Opinionated - Many ways to achieve a result
4) Hardware management
5) For the weak!!! ðŸ’ª
