# What is Kubernetes?
---

# Srsly. What is it?

1) Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services.
2) It facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. 
3) It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem - Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.

> The name Kubernetes originates from Greek, meaning helmsman or pilot. Google open-sourced the Kubernetes project in 2014. Kubernetes builds upon a decade and a half of experience that Google has with running production workloads at scale, combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.
